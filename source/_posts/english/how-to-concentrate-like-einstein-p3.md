## Experts Best Practices To Improve The Lazy Student's Concentration

### Content

#### Best Practice 1

**How to instantly recover your power of concentration when you feel stressed or anxious.**

Stress, worries and anxiety can directly impact your ability to concentrate, and thus your ability to memorize things.

When your are under stress conditions, you may feel your mind **[foggy](#foggy)** and sometimes **[sloppy](#sloppy)**, as if you were in another place, not really present.

In such conditions, it is **[essential](#essential)** to regain a clear mind before being able to concentrate again.

Here is a very particular breathing technique developed by the world **[renowned](#renowned)** expert in personal efficiency Philippe Morando, with **particularly beneficial effects.**

You anxiety, fears, negative thoughts will disappear instantly each time you will use this breathing.

You can use this special breathing any time of the day, whenever you feel stressed and need to relax or to **[confront](#confront)** situations that require having a complete self-control.

In a couple of minutes, your inner peace and **[calm](#calm)** will be restored as efficiently as a deep **[meditation](#meditation)**.

This technique has the advantage to be simple and **[discreet](#discreet)**.

So, you can use it anywhere, at any moment without anybody noticing.

You can be in a standing or sitting position, or lying down on the back.

If you chose a sitting position, your arms and your legs should not be **[crossed](#crossed)**. Take care that your body can loosen without falling or moving.

**Procedure For The Special Breathing**

Initial condition: **Mouth should be closed during all the phases.**

##### 1- First Phase: Breathing in.

> Length: in general 4 seconds minimum.

First take a deep breath through the nose, without forcing. Hearing the sound of air in you **[nostrils](#nostrils)** proves the breath you took is correct: **[vigorous](#vigorous)** but without **[roughness](#roughness)**.

While your lungs are filling with air, the air will naturally push forward you **[diaphragm](#diaphragm)** and also your **[belly](#belly)**. It is important here not to force to push forward your **[belly](#belly)**. Let things happen naturally. Your belly will be pushed forward by itself.

After several times, you could try to take a little more air than the first times. When you reach your maximum, still try to take a little bit more air: trying to increase the capacity of your **[ribcage](#ribcage)** will have a **[massaging](#massaging)** action on the **[solar](#solar)** **[plexus](#plexus)** and thus it will relax your nerves.

##### 2- Second phase: [Intermediate](#intermediate) phase

> Length: about 3 seconds.

When your lungs are completely filled with air, try to keep the air for about 3 seconds, then you can loosen everything. Don't force yourself to keep the air too long: 3 seconds are enough in general.

##### 3- Third phase: Breathing out

> Length: in general about 6 seconds.

Your lungs empty themselves. You breathe out through the nose. Don't force to remove the air from your lungs. The air will get out of your lungs naturally.

The breathing out should be like a relaxation, a loosening. Don't try to empty completely your lungs. The air should get out naturally without your help lie a balloon that **[deflates](#deflates)**. No matter if it remains a little bit air in you lungs.

***Note***: _This phase of breathing out is a loosening phase. So, each time you breathe out, you can add a small sound of relief like "hummm" (mouth still closed). By this sound, you show your determination to let yourself go._

##### 4- Fourth phase: Resting phase

> Length: From 2 to 10 seconds and even more

At the end of the breathing out, you may not feel the need to start to breathe again immediately. So, keep this state with lungs almost empty, without looking for breathing again right now. Enjoy this state of **well-being**.

When you **want to breathe in** again, and only at this moment, start again the phase 1.

> You can do 2 or 3 special breathings whenever you need.

> You can also do 5 minutes of this special breathing in the morning when you wake up, and 5 minutes in the evening before falling asleep.

> You will then create a very good habit in the long term: your breathing will become better during the day, and you could notice that you will **[adopt](#adopt)** **[spontaneously](spontaneously)** this special breathing during the difficult moments of the day.

**How To Concentrate To Reduce Your Study Time By 3 Or More And Instantly Increase Your Efficiency**

If you are a student, you surely know one or two students who give an incredible impression of being always relaxed, always free for a baseball game or a party. They never seem to be working so much and yet, the almost always get good grades!

This is partly due to the fact that they know how to manage their study time efficiently when they study alone and don't depend on a teacher or a lecturer.

This allows them to have a maximum concentration during a minimum amount of time.

Thus, they have more free time and get much better results compared to other students who work for hours late in the evening.

Here are the best students' secrets to manage your study time when you study alone:

##### Secret 1- Set A Precise Hour For Your Study And Respect It

It is essential that you create one very good habit: **to study at the same time every day.**

It will **[accustom](#accustom)** your brain to be focused and concentrated on your study at a given moment.

How can you find your own moment for your study?

Just have a look at the timetable of one of your typical week. Then, choose the hour where you are free every day.

There is not a **[strict](#strict)** rule concerning a potential 'best hour' to study. The best hour will be simply the one you prefer!

It can be early in the morning or in the evening. Just make sure you have enough time to sleep, for example if you decide to study between 5h30 to 7h00 a.m.

Indeed, sleeping plays an important role in the memorization process. It is during your sleep that your brain organizes and stores all the information you learned during the day.

Before you continue, note here the moment you chose to study every day.

**"Every day, I will study from: ...h... to ...h..."**

Now, the only thing you have to do is to respect what you wrote just above.

Respect the moment you choose and don't change this moment every week.

You will know that you are on the road to your success when you will be able to stop your favorite TV show just because it is the time you set for your study: This is one of the winners' secrets/

You will then appreciate the new comfort of life this organization brings you, and you could enjoy how free is your mind during the rest of the day!

##### Secret 2- How To Make The Most Of your Study Periods

Once you set precisely your study periods with the tool just above, you will now want to be as efficient as possible during this moment.

To do this, it is psychologically **[essential](#essential)** to spend a few minutes to determine **what you want** and **how much time you have to acquire it**.

You can find this by answering these 2 question:

_a-What knowledge do you want to acquire by this work?_

**AND**

_b-How much time do you have in order to do this work?_

**a-What knowledge do you want to acquire by this work?**

Here, you are setting a goal in order to focus your brain and memory to find the information you want.

With a goal, the brain and the memory work much better because they exactly know what must be found and memorized.

This step is very important, don't **[neglect](#neglect)** it.

So, answer this question as precisely as possible, and **write down your answer.**

For instance, if you want to study Ernest HEMINGWAY, don't just write a general answer like: "I want to know Ernest HEMINGWAY", but prepare a list of what you want to know about him, even if you want to know everything.

**b-How much time do you have in order to do this work?**

Before answering this second question, you have to know that:

**The more time we HAVE,**
**the more time we TAKE.**

Often unnecessarily.

This principle has been verified thousands of times and illustrates perfectly that **the brain acts in the limits it is given.**

It can be also known as the Parkinson's law: "Work **[expands](#expands)** so as to fill the time available for its completion."

It means that if you give yourself 2 hours to do a work, it is likely that you will spend 2 hours. If you give yourself 3 hours for the same work, you will surely spend 3 hours.

Your work will be often better with less time because it will appear easier (except if the time allocated is really too short). Indeed, the more the amount of time spent on a work is large, the more this work will appear as being **[voluminous](#voluminous)** and complex.

Moreover, **takig less time will force you to get rid of distractions.**

It will put you under a high concentration state in order to remain focused on the **[essential](#essential)**.

So, _instead of asking yourself how much time you have to do a work, it is much better to ask yourself in how much time YOU decide to do this work._

**EVEN IF IT SEEM SURPRISING, REMEMBER THAT IS POSSIBLE TO WORK BOT _QUICKLY_ AND _WELL_.**

On condition that follow a clear and precise plan, and that you know exactly what you want to obtain and in how much time.

SET YOURSELF goals and you will make great **[strides](#strides)** in your life.

##### Secret 3- Take Regular Breaks

Tiredness is a cause of inattention and can happen to everyone, even to people who have a good attention in general.

If you feel tired, it is likely that you won't be able to concentrate correctly and there is no need to insist too much.

You should really avoid working to the point of exhaustion and you should take regular breaks while you are studying.

A break that lasts 4 or 5 minutes is enough.

The general rule is that one hour and half of **[intellectual](#intellectual)** work should be a maximum to not **[overpass](#overpass)** without taking a break.

![BUT THE BEST IS TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK EVERY 45 MINUTES.](https://sherlockblaze/resources/img/english/break-time.png)

#### Best Practice 3

**How Your Study Place Can Increase Your Concentration By 27% And More In Two Simple Steps**.

##### Step 1

**How To Create A Comfortable And Welcoming Study Place**

Your study place should be comfortable and welcoming enough to make you feel good when you are there. 

> Comfort stats by **choosing a good chair**. If the chair is not comfortable, it will induce pain and **[interfere](#interfere)** with your studying.
If the chair is too comfortable, it will make you sleepy and also **[interfere](#interfere)** with your studying.
Select a chair on which you can sit and maintain your attention for long periods.

To make your study place more welcoming and cheerful (without being **[eccentric](#eccentrice)**), you can **play with colors.**

However be careful, there are some notions to know concerning the **[symbolism](#symbolism)** of colors:

**RED**

Symbol of fire, blood and **[conquest](#conquest)**. It strongly **[stimulates](#stimulates)** the nervous system.

**ORANGE**

Linked to emotions. It is less stimulating than red and gives a more welcoming and **[cozy](#cozy) [atmosphere](#atmosphere)**

**YELLOW**

Refers to light, **[evokes](#evokes) [material](#material)** and **[spiritual](#spiritual)** wealth. Yellow symbolizes the energy of a bright sunny day. It awakes and **[mobilizes](#mobilizes)** the body and mind but without being **[over-stimulating](#over-stimulating)** like red.

**GREEN**

Depending on its **[dominant](#dominant) [proportion](#proportion)** of yellow or blue, it can be either a warm or cold color. It is the most restful color for the nervous system and it symbolizes peace. That is why you can find a lot of green in games like billiard or in conference rooms. The nature also provides more green than stimulating colors.

**BLUE**

It is a cold and **[calming](#calm)** color. It is associated with night, sleep and relaxation.

**INDIGO & PURPLE**

With a **[predominance](#predominance)** of blue, purple is the symbol of the union between the man and the sacred. A **[predominance](#predominance)** of red symbolizes the power of the **[earthly](#earthly) [reign](#reign)** (purple of kings, judicial robe).
