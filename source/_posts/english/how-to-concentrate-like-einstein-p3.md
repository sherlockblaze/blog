#### Best Practice 1

**How to instantly recover your power of concentration when you feel stressed or anxious.**

Stress, worries and anxiety can directly impact your ability to concentrate, and thus your ability to memorize things.

When your are under stress conditions, you may feel your mind **[foggy](#foggy)** and sometimes **[sloppy](#sloppy)**, as if you were in another place, not really present.

In such conditions, it is **[essential](#essential)** to regain a clear mind before being able to concentrate again.

Here is a very particular breathing technique developed by the world **[renowned](#renowned)** expert in personal efficiency Philippe Morando, with **particularly beneficial effects.**

You anxiety, fears, negative thoughts will disappear instantly each time you will use this breathing.

You can use this special breathing any time of the day, whenever you feel stressed and need to relax or to **[confront](#confront)** situations that require having a complete self-control.

In a couple of minutes, your inner peace and calm will be restored as efficiently as a deep **[meditation](#meditation)**.

This technique has the advantage to be simple and **[discreet](#discreet)**.

So, you can use it anywhere, at any moment without anybody noticing.

You can be in a standing or sitting position, or lying down on the back.

If you chose a sitting position, your arms and your legs should not be **[crossed](#crossed)**. Take care that your body can loosen without falling or moving.

**Procedure For The Special Breathing**

Initial condition: **Mouth should be closed during all the phases.**

#### 1- First Phase: Breathing in.

> Length: in general 4 seconds minimum.

First take a deep breath through the nose, without forcing. Hearing the sound of air in you **[nostrils](#nostrils)** proves the breath you took is correct: **[vigorous](#vigorous)** but without **[roughness](#roughness)**.

While your lungs are filling with air, the air will naturally push forward you **[diaphragm](#diaphragm)** and also your **[belly](#belly)**. It is important here not to force to push forward your **[belly](#belly)**. Let things happen naturally. Your belly will be pushed forward by itself.

After several times, you could try to take a little more air than the first times. When you reach your maximum, still try to take a little bit more air: trying to increase the capacity of your **[ribcage](#ribcage)** will have a **[massaging](#massaging)** action on the **[solar](#solar)** **[plexus](#plexus)** and thus it will relax your nerves.

#### 2- Second phase: [Intermediate](#intermediate) phase

> Length: about 3 seconds.

When your lungs are completely filled with air, try to keep the air for about 3 seconds, then you can loosen everything. Don't force yourself to keep the air too long: 3 seconds are enough in general.

#### 3- Third phase: Breathing out

> Length: in general about 6 seconds.

Your lungs empty themselves. You breathe out through the nose. Don't force to remove the air from your lungs. The air will get out of your lungs naturally.

The breathing out should be like a relaxation, a loosening. Don't try to empty completely your lungs. The air should get out naturally without your help lie a balloon that **[deflates](#deflates)**. No matter if it remains a little bit air in you lungs.
