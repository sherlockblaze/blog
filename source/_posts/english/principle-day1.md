## Principle Day One

**Think for yourself to decide 1) What you want, 2) What is true, and 3) What you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2...**

**...and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you.** Being clear on your principles is important because they will affect all aspects of your life, many times a day. For example, when you enter into relationships with others, your principles and their principles will determine how you interact. People who don't will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflicts. Think about the people you are closest to: Are their values aligned with yours? Do you even know what their values or principles are? Too often in relationships, people's principles aren't clear. This is especially problematic in organizations where people need to have shared principles to be successful.
**Being crystal clear about my principles is why I labored so much over every sentence in this book.**
