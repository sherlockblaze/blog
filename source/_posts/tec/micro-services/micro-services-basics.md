## What's it?

For many years now , we have been finding better ways to build systems.

Eric Evans's book Domain-Driven Design(Addison-Wesley) helped us understand the importance of representing the real world in our code, and showed use better ways to model our system. The concept of continuous delivery showed how we can more effectively and efficiently get our software into production, instilling in us the idea that we should treat every check-in as a release candidate. Our understanding of how the Web works has led us to develop better ways of having machines talk to other machines.

Alistair Cockburn's concept of **hexagonal architecture** guided us away from layered architectures where business logic could hide.

Virtualization platforms allowed us to provision and resize our machines at will, with infrastructure automation giving us a way to handle these machines at scale. Some large, successful organizations like Amazon and Google espoused the view of small teams owning the full lifecycle of their services. And, more recently, Netflix has shared with us ways of building anti-fragile system at a scale that would have been hard to comprehend just 10 years ago.
