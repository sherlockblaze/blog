Here I'll review all my knowledge that i have got before and haven't got yet. It includes not only **Computer Science** but also **Mathematics**, **English**, **Physics** and so on.
It will be a long-term battle, and the content will be updated everyday. I will:

+ **Review theoretical knowledge from Monday to Friday and do some exercises or write codes on weekends. Find some classic and difficult exercises to complete if it is a basic subject;**
+ **Discuss some classic or excellent projects, such as an Operating System, Network Protocols, Redis, Nginx and so on;**
+ **Practical drill. From the beginning.**
