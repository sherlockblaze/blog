Here I'll review all my knowledge that i have got before and haven't got yet. It includes not only **Computer Science** but also **Mathematics**, **English**, **Physics** and so on.
It will be a long-term battle, and the content will be updated everyday. I will:

+ **Review theoretical knowledge from Monday to Friday and do some exercises or write codes on weekends. Find some classic and difficult exercises to complete if it is a basic subject;**
+ **Discuss some classic or excellent projects, such as an Operating System, Network Protocols, Redis, Nginx and so on;**
+ **Practical drill. From the beginning.**

If you have something interesting to learn, let me know at the comments, let's fight together.
And if you like the theme. Look out at [here](https://github.com/sherlockblaze/hexo-theme-new_BeanTech_theme).
And we can take more about something not in my notes at [Commutiy](https://sherlockblaze.com/community/).

THANKS.
