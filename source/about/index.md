Here I'll review all my knowledge that i have got before and haven't got yet. It includes not only **Computer Science** but also **Mathematics**, **English**, **Physics** and so on.
It will be a long-term battle, and the content will be updated everyday. I will:

+ **Review theoretical knowledge from Monday to Friday and do some exercises or write codes on weekends. Find some classic and difficult exercises to complete if it is a basic subject;**
+ **Discuss some classic or excellent projects, such as an Operating System, Network Protocols, Redis, Nginx and so on;**
+ **Practical drill. From the beginning.**

## Environment

1. work with c11
2. work with c++11
3. work with python3.6
4. work with cuda10 (My Version: Nvidia Geforce 2080 Ti x 1)
5. work with go1.11.4

## Code

You can view all code about my notes [here](https://github.com/sherlockblaze/all_knowledge_review).
