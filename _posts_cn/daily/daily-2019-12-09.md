## Adapter design pattern

**In Go, an adapter will allow us to use something that wasn't built for a specific task at the beginning.**

The Adapter pattern is very useful when, for example, an interface gets outdated and it's not possible to replace it easily or fast. Instead, you create a new interface to deal with the current needs of your application, which, under the hood, uses implementations of the old interface.

> Just keep in mind that extensibility in code is only possible through the use of design patterns and interface-oriented programming.

### Objectives

The Adapter design pattern will help you fit the needs of two parts of the code that are incompatible at first.

```golang
package structural

import "fmt"

type LegacyPrinter interface {
    Print(s string) string
}

type MyLegacyPrinter struct {}

func (l *MyLegacyPrinter) Print(s string) (newMsg string) {
    newMsg = fmt.Sprintf("Legacy Printer: %s\n", s)
    println(newMsg)
    return
}

type NewPrinter interface {
    PrintStored() string
}

type PrinterAdapter struct {
    oldPrinter LegacyPrinter
    Msg        string
}

func (p *PrinterAdapter) PrintStored() (newMsg string) {
    if p.OldPrinter != nil {
        newMsg = fmt.Sprintf("Adapter: %s", p.Msg)
        newMsg = p.OldPrinter.Print(newMsg)
    } else {
        newMsg = p.Msg
    }

    return
}
```

## Bridge design pattern

The Bridge pattern is a design with a slightly cryptic definition from the original Gang of Four book. **It decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.** The cryptic explanation just means that you could even decouple the most basic form of functionality: **decouple an object from what it does.**

The Bridge pattern tries to decouple things as usual with design patterns. It decouples abstraction (an object) from its implementation (the thing that the object does). This way, we can change what an object does as much as we want. It also allows us to change the abstracted object while reusing the same implementation.

The objective of the Bride pattern is to bring flexibility to a struct that change often. Knowing the inputs and outputs of a method, it allows us to change code without knowing too much about it and leaving the freedom for both sides to be modified more easily.

```golang
package structural

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
    "io"
)

type PrinterAPI interface {
    PrintMessage(string) error
}

type PrinterAPI1 struct {}

func (d *PrinterAPI1) PrintMessage(msg string) error {
    fmt.Printf("%s\n", msg)
    return nil
}

type PrinterAPI2 struct{}

func (d *PrinterAPI2) PrintMessage(msg string) error {
    if d.Writer == nil {
        return errors.New("You need to pass an io.Writer to PrinterAPI2")
    }
    fmt.Printf(d.Writer, "%s", msg)
    return nil
}

type PrinterAbstraction interface {
    Print() error
}

type NormalPrinter struct {
    Msg     string
    Printer PrinterAPI
}

func (c *NormalPrinter) Print() error {
    c.Printer.PrintMessage(c.Msg)
    return nil
}

type PacktPrinter struct {
    Msg     string
    Printer PrinterAPI
}

func (c *PacktPrinter) Print() error {
    c.Printer.PrintMessage(fmt.Sprintf("Message from Packt: %s", c.Msg))
    return nil
}
```
